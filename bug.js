```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <p>This is some text.</p>
</div>
```
This code will produce unexpected results. The gradient will not be applied correctly because the `from-blue-500` and `to-purple-500` classes are not correctly used within the gradient function. The correct way to write this is:
```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 via-blue-600 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <p>This is some text.</p>
</div>
```
